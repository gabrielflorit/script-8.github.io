- title: Game loop
  dl:
  -
    - initialState
    - Assign your game's initial state to this. It must be a serializable object, e.g. don't put a function in there. After setting it once, do not modify it directly unless you want unpredictable behavior. Instead, mutate `state` in `update` (see below).
  -
    - update(state, input, elapsed)
    - "This function is called before `draw`. `state` is your game's state. Mutate state here. Note that you should not assign a new variable to `state`. Instead, assign individual properties. For example, don't do this: `state = { lives: 0}`. Do this: `state.lives = 0`. `elapsed` is time passed since last `update` call. See below for an explanation of `input`."

    - drawActors(state, fade)
    - docs coming
  -
    - draw(state)
    - This function is called after `draw`. `state` is your game's state.
- title: Input
  dl:
  -
    - ''
    - "The `update` function receives `input` as its second parameter. It's an object of booleans, each representing whether a button is pressed or not: up, right, down, left, a, b, start, select. On keyboards, the last two represent Enter and Space, respectively. For example, if you're holding right and up, `input` will be { right: true, up: true }."
- title: Draw
  note: non-integers are rounded down
  dl:
  -
    - print(x, y, text, [color=0])
    - Draws `text` at xy.
  -
    - line(x1, y1, x2, y2, [color=0])
    - Draws line from x1y1 to x2y2.
  -
    - rectStroke(x, y, width, height, [color=0])
    - Strokes a rectangle at xy.
  -
    - rectFill(x, y, width, height, [color=0])
    - Fills a rectangle at xy.
  -
    - circStroke(x, y, radius, [color=0])
    - Strokes a circle at xy.
  -
    - circFill(x, y, radius, [color=0])
    - Fills a circle at xy.
  -
    - polyStroke(points, [rotate, [x, y]], color)
    - "Strokes a polygon as defined by an array of points, each point being a two-element array. You do not need to close the polygon. For example, to draw a square at 0,0: `polyStroke([[0,0], [4,0], [4,4], [0, 4]], 0)`. `rotate` is in degrees. If `rotate` is supplied, but no xy, rotates the polygon. If `rotate` and `xy` is supplied, rotates the polygon about xy. Note color is not optional."
  -
    - sprite(x, y, spriteIndex, [brighten, flipX])
    - Draws the sprite at xy. `spriteIndex` is an integer between 0 and 127. The optional integer `brighten` will draw the sprite's pixels brighter by the specified amount. Negative values darken the sprite. If `flipX` is true, mirrors the sprite along the y axis.
  -
    - clear([c])
    - Clears the screen. Optionally pass in a color to draw the entire screen with that color.
  -
    - tile(mx, my)
    - If found, returns the sprite at this location. `mx` and `my` are in map coordinates. The result is an array, with a `type` property indicating the sprite type (0-1-2-3).
  -
    - map([mx=0, my=0])
    - Draws the map. `mx` and `my` are in map coordinates, e.g. mx=1, my=1 is the top-left map tile.
  -
    - camera([x=0, y=0])
    - Offsets the top-left corner from subsequent draw coordinates. Call `camera()` to reset it.
- title: Utility
  dl:
  -
    - range([start=0], end, [step=1])
    - Creates an array of numbers from `start` up to `end`, not inclusive. <a class='text' href='https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#range'>By Lodash</a>.
  -
    - flatten(array)
    - Flattens `array` a single level deep. <a class='text' href='https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#flatten'>By Lodash</a>.
  -
    - random([lower=0], [upper=1])
    - Returns a random number between `lower` and `upper`. <a class='text' href='https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#random'>By Lodash</a>.
  -
    - clamp(number, [lower], upper)
    - Clamps `number` between inclusive `lower` and `upper`. <a class='text' href='https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#clamp'>By Lodash</a>.
  -
    - log(message)
    - Prints `message` to browser console.
